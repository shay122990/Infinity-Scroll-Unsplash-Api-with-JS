# Infinite Scroll using Unsplash API, built with JS.

## About The Project

This is a responsive infinite image scroll. Mimicing Social Media effect.
By using Unsplash random image API, we can scroll through endless amount of images. The load of images is set to 30, so when we reach the end of scroll, we load another 30, therefore creating an infinite illusion.
This is one way to implement this effect with vanilla js.
You can add this to your projects or learn some methods applied.

## Built With

You should be familiar with JS basics. However I have linked some resources used in this project.
Also, if you do decide to give this project a try. You have to sign up to [Unsplash API Documentation ](https://unsplash.com/documentation) to get your own API key. In my project I have decided to hide my API key, if you're not familiar with how to do so. [This is a link to a github page](https://gist.github.com/derzorngottes/3b57edc1f996dddcab25) that gives you a step by step.

## Installation

This is a working code example.
You can copy the CSS and Javascript code as is and use it in your projects.
Or you can download the code as a ZIP file and unzip it. No web server required, you can see it live through your localhost by opening index.html with your browser. Alternatively, you can open your project with VS Code (download live server extension) and click on **Go Live** at the bottom right corner, it should open in your default browser.
